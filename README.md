# GOOLA
Commerce Website

## Contents
Goola is a website designed for a modern urban-esk feel. It contains a fixed nav bar at the top with a custom logo. Underneath that is a banner that was made to juxtapose the white logo on an abstract design. Below that we begin to see the tabs for filters in our ecommerce website. In displays less than 600px, a drop down menu appears rather than the individual categories. Underneath that we have a nice layout of products that scale according to image. Using max-min width, we are able to create responsive and dynamic product frames. They are interactable as well with hover psuedoclasses that contrast against the white space in the background. They really pop out. The products were made using a function that takes an argument for an image and a description, letting one loop through an array to created multiple products with one function. Very dynamic and easy to modify.
